### Introduction:
This README provides detailed instructions and guidelines for completing the Class Assignment 1 (CA1) - Version Control with Git. The assignment involves setting up a simple software project for registering company employees and conducting tutorials on version control using Git.

The instructions are divided into two main parts:

  - First Part: Setting up the project, creating a repository, downloading necessary resources, and implementing specific features.

  - Second Part: Demonstrating a simple Git workflow, including branching, implementing new features, fixing bugs, and tagging versions.

Each step is accompanied by detailed instructions on what needs to be done, including command-line commands and explanations where necessary.

## First Part:

### 1. Login in your GitHub account

[GitHub home page](https://github.com//);

### 2. Create an empty repository in GitHub with the following name "devops-23-24-jpe-psm-1231847.":

- Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the homepage.
- In the top right corner, click on your avatar and select "Your repositories" from the dropdown menu.
- On the "Your repositories" page, click the green "New" button located in the top right corner.
- On the "Create a new repository" page, fill in the following details:
  - Repository name: "devops-23-24-jpe-psm-1231847"
  - Visibility: Check the "Private" option to make the repository private.
-   Create a repository;
-   Copy the repository link;
-   On command line, navigate to the desired folder to save the tutorial, in this case it was used:

    > cd c:/
    > 
    > cd /home/miguelcouto/repos

-   Create a folder to keep your repository:

    > mkdir devOps

-   Initialize your local repository:

    > cd devops 
    > 
    >git init

-   Create a new folder named CA1:

    > mkdir CA1


### 3. Grant to your professors admin rights:


- Go to your repository on GitHub. 
- Click on "Settings" tab at the top of the repository.
- In the settings menu, select "Manage access" from the sidebar.
- Invite Collaborators:
    - Under "Collaborators", type the email address of the professor you want to invite.
    - Press Enter to add the collaborator.
    - Select the collaborator's permission level. If you want them to have admin access, choose "Admin".
    - Click on "Add [Collaborator]" to send the invitation.

    
### 4. Create issue(s) in GitHub main task:

-   At the top of the repository page, click on the "Issues" tab.
-   On the right side of the page, click on the "New issue" button.
-  In the "Title" field, enter a descriptive title for the issue.

>
> git push
## Analysis of the alternative:

## Comparison of Mercurial and Git:
Mercurial (Hg) is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that serves as an alternative to Git. It shares many similarities with Git but offers a different approach to version control. In this section, we will analyze how Mercurial compares to Git in terms of version control features and describe how Mercurial could be used to achieve the same goals as presented in this assignment.



| Feature             | Mercurial (Hg)                                          | Git                                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**           | Distributed: Each user has a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work and independent branching and merging. | Distributed: Similar to Mercurial, Git also follows a distributed model, allowing each user to have a full copy of the repository.|
| **Branching**       | Mercurial has lightweight branches that are easy to create and manage. Branches are typically used for short-term, experimental changes. | Git provides powerful branching and merging capabilities, allowing for complex branching strategies such as feature branching, release branching, and hotfix branching. |
| **Performance**     | Mercurial's performance is generally comparable to Git, offering efficient operations for common version control tasks. | Git is known for its fast performance, especially when it comes to operations like commit, merge, and checkout. |
| **History Tracking**| Mercurial tracks changes and history both locally and remotely, allowing users to view the complete history of the repository. | Git also tracks changes and history locally and remotely, providing a comprehensive view of the project's development over time. |
| **Conflict Handling**| Mercurial automatically merges changes and flags conflicts when necessary, making it easy for users to resolve conflicts during the merge process. | Git automatically merges changes and identifies conflicts, requiring users to manually resolve conflicts by editing the affected files. |
| **Windows Support** | Mercurial offers good support for Windows users, with native tools like TortoiseHg providing a user-friendly interface. | Git provides decent support for Windows users, although some third-party tools may be required for a smoother experience compared to native Unix-based systems. |
| **Community**       | Mercurial has an active community, but it's generally smaller compared to Git. However, it still offers ample resources and support for users. | Git boasts a large and vibrant community with extensive resources, including documentation, tutorials, forums, and third-party tools, making it one of the most widely used version control systems. |

Overall, both Mercurial and Git are powerful version control systems with their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them often depends on factors such as personal preference, team familiarity, project requirements, and specific use cases.








## Implementation of the alternative:

Below is a comparison of Mercurial commands with their Git counterparts, ensuring a clear understanding of how to perform similar version control operations using Mercurial.

| Command                                  | Git                    | Mercurial          |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Initialize local repository              | >git init              | > hg init project  |
| Clone repository from browser            | >git clone  <url>      | > hg clone <url>    |
| Connect to remote repository             | >git remote add origin | > hg pull -f <url> |
| Commit changes to the repository         | >git commit            | >hg commit -m      |
| Check the state of the working directory | > git status           | > hg status        |
| Add all changes                          | > git add *            | > hg addremove     |
| Create a tag                             | > git tag              | > hg tag           |
| Share changes                            | > git push             | > hg push          |
| Merge branches                          | > git merge            | > hg merge         |
| Create branches                         | > git branch           | > hg branch        |
| Checkout a branch                       | > git checkout         | > hg update        |

This comparison helps understand how Mercurial commands align with those of Git, facilitating a seamless transition for users familiar with Git's workflow.
